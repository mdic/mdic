I'm a linguist, specialised in Corpus and Cognitive Linguistics, and CADS (Corpus-Assisted Discourse Studies). 

I have worked in several interdisciplinary projects, developing methods and tools to collaborate with different disciplines - from the project design to the data analysis, using Free/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) - providing a linguistic perspective to better understand the data under investigation.

I teach academic modules in Digital Humanities, Corpus Linguistics, and Text Mining.
